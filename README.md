## Download Module
> [!TIP]
You can download the module from [Releases](https://github.com/ZG089/Re-Malwack/releases/latest) section.


## Get started
> [!NOTE]
> 1. Open Magisk, go to Modules section, click on the '+' icon, then select the Re-Malwack Module zip file to install.
> 2. Reboot your device to activate the Re-Malwack Module's protective features.

## Command Usage (How to use Re-Malwack on Termux)
> [!NOTE]
> - It's not required to use it on terminal if you want to update hosts.

Type``su -c rmlwk`` on Termux to show up the help message which will clarify how to use it:

```
Usage: rmlwk [options]
--reset: Restore original hosts file.
--block-porn: Block pornographic sites.
--block-gambling: Block gambling sites.
--block-fake: Block fake news sites.
--whitelist <domain>: Whitelist a domain.
--blacklist <domain>: Blacklist a domain.
--update-hosts: Update the hosts file.
--help, -h: Display help.
```

> [!TIP]
> - You can update hosts file by going into magisk, and press the action button on the module, besides updating it un Termux

> [!WARNING]
> Do not use this module with any other ad blocker module, such as AdAway and Magisk's built-in systemless hosts module.

> [!NOTE]
> - For KernelSU users and for those who noticed that the hosts file isn't updated after running ``su -c rmlwk --update-hosts``, install [Overlayfs](https://github.com/HuskyDG/magic_overlayfs) module, configure it and it will work. (if you need help configuring it then contact with me via Telegram or XDA)


## Total Blocked
> [!TIP]
> - 910,553+ Malware, Ads, Spyware


## How does it work? - Frequently Asked Questions
> [!TIP]
> **Where is the file?**
> - Your ``hosts`` file located in ``/system/etc``. It "acts" like your school blocking service that blocks you from going to websites. However, this (the ``Hosts`` file) is done locally on your phone's root system. 

> [!TIP]
> **How does the host's file block websites and what modifications were made?**
> - How does it block websites: The host file blocks websites and malware by denying access for your phone to connect to it at all. It will just return a blank page. ``0.0.0.0 www.the-website-that-is-blocked.com``.

> [!TIP]
> **Does it blocks in-app ads and in-game ads as well ?**
> - Of course it does ! All of this using the magic of magisk and the hosts file !
